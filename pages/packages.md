# Package Documentation

Currently, documentation is a bit all over the place. This list is certainly
not extensive, but I find it helpful to have quick links to the frequently
used packages.

## Core Documentation

 * [ROS 2 Overview](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/index.html)
 * [Ament CMake](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.html)
 * [ROS 2 Launch](https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/master/launch/doc/source/architecture.rst)

## Higher Level Packages

 * [MoveIt2](https://moveit.ros.org/)
   * If encountering errors about OpenGL Context when running setup assistant, restart the computer. This is usually caused by mismatched versions of NVIDIA drivers.
 * [Navigation2](https://navigation.ros.org/)
